# SEARCH WITH REACT HOOKS

Main aim of this project is to create a basic search engine. Search is executed via e-mail or the name of the customer.

## Used Technologies

In the project I used:

### React

Main technology for searching list of elements.


### React Hooks

I used React Hooks in order to  use state and other React features without writing a class.

### react-bootstrap

React-Bootstrap is a complete re-implementation of the Bootstrap components using React. React-Bootstrap simplifies this by condensing the original Bootstrap into React-styled components.

### CSS

### Font-Awesome
